# Project Overview
The goal of this project to showcase three powerful dashboards that can be used to improve marketing decisions. We will do a buyer persona dashboard to understand the demographics of our customers. Next we will create a email marketing dashboard that can help understand what types of email campaign work best and when to send them to your email lists. Finally we will look at a quick way to see which promotions are making the strongest waves when it comes to sales. These dashboards are a great tool to increase the ROI for marketing campaigns and adds great value to marketing managers and sales to direct their attention to what is going to directly increase sales. 

The datasets are sample dummy data from Google Anaytics and Kaggle. I will have copies of the datasets used in my Github Repo for this project.

## Part I: Buyer Persona Dashboard
First we start off with a good way of visualizing demographic data of customer in an easy to read and interactive dashboard. Below we will go over each portion of the dashboard and how we can use it to indetify who are our customers.

We have created idivdual KPIs, shown below, and place them at the top of our dashboard. I like to include these as numbers instead on the Tooltip of the graph so it give a good visual on what the numbers are when we start to filter in data.

These are important to have for a marketing manager or sales person who want to get the information as quickly as possible. Without getting into too much of the weed, below are breif explaination of the KPIs.

*Total Sales: We can use this to see what is selling the highest, where are we getting the highest sales, etc.  
*Average Sale: Good indicator of the type of customers. Do they buy few expensive items, or a lot of inexpensive items?  
*Number of Customers: Good when analysing territories and seeing where we are getting the most traction for our products/service.  



## Part II: Email Marketing Dashboard

## Part III: Promotional Impact 

## Final Thoughts
Many data science websites, bloggers, and teachers say that data processing and cleaning can be take up to 50-80 percent of your time on a project. Meaning these tools and skills can be the most important part and ensures reliability in the conclusions we make in our analysis. As I do more projects, I can attest to the fact that most models can be reused. One can use a template to get most of the model up and running in a relatively short amount of time. Total, without the 30 plus minute SSIS conditional split, it took us about 45 minutes to just find five errors in this challenge. One can only imagine Big Data datasets that can have billions of rows...I think I would need a couple computers, or maybe a GPU on AWS?
