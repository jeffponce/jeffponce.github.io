For the last 6 years I've been working in product sales through manufactures and distribution in the industrial, mechanical, and fire protection industries. Planning to use my knowledge in sales, marketing, project management and product development to aide me in developing my business solution tools and dashboards.

During my journey I learned a lot of concepts and developed a lot of skills, such us : Data cleaning, Data mining, Data visualizations, Business Intelligence, Database Normalization and Marketing value-add.

Tools and Languages: Tableau, Python, MS SQL, PostGreSQL, PowerBI, Excel, Google Analytics.
