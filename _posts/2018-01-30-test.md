# US Non-Profit - Data Cleaning and Anaylsis

## Background
Goal of this project is to better understand US Non-profit organizations and how they performed versus each other on income, revenue, and assets. Furthermore, we will look at the Top 10 Non-profits in the regions set up and Top 10 per state. The Dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contained information on US Non-profits broken up into three regions. We will analysis the data, isolate the info needed, and export data to be visualized in Tableau.
